Theredrunner is a simple Python game built using the Pygame library. In this game, you control a red square on the screen, moving it around with the arrow keys. The goal is just to explore the screen while ensuring that the square doesn't go outside the boundaries.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, and down) to move the red square around the screen.
The square will be confined within the screen's boundaries, preventing it from going off-screen.
Features

The game window will close when the user clicks the close button.
Basic controls and no win/loss conditions â€“ it's just for fun!
